Read all unchecked tasks in .windsurf/TASK.md.
For each task, take action to complete it.
After completing, update the task status in .windsurf/TASK.md immediately.
Continue this process until all tasks are marked complete.
Log all changes and notes directly in the file for clear traceability.

Be sure to give comprehensive descriptions for each tool so the MCP server can effectively communicate to the LLM when and how to use each capability.
