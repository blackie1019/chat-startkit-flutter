Use the Context7 and Brave MCP servers to get documentation right away after reading the ARCHITECTURE and task files.

Also use the Brave MCP server to search the web for supplemental docs/examples to aid in creating the agent.

Be sure to give comprehensive descriptions for each tool so the MCP server can effectively communicate to the LLM when and how to use each capability.
